**Problem Statement:** How can we optimize user engagement and satisfaction for an online game through a thorough analysis of
user preferences and behaviors?

**Approach:** We conducted an in-depth analysis of user gameplay data using advanced SQL techniques, including the HAVING
clause, stored procedures, and sub-queries. This involved identifying key metrics and patterns to pinpoint areas for enhancing the
user experience.

**#Conclusion:** Through our analysis of user gameplay data, we uncovered comprehensive insights into various aspects of the game,
including property types, popular neighbourhoods, booking trends, pricing dynamics, and customer preferences. These insights
empower stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions, ultimately leading to an enhanced user experience.
